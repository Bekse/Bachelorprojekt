        <h2>What is Embedded Stock?</h2>
        <h5>Embedded Stock is an initiative to create a central storage space for all electronic hardware at the Aarhus University School of Engineering â€“ Katrinebjerg.
        </h5>
        <h2>How to make a loan:</h2>
        <p>If you find hardware you wish to borrow you simply press the reserve button.<br>
            <br>
            Pick up your reservation within opening hours in the Embedded Stock store. It is located in room 017A in the Shannon building at Katrinebjerg.<br>
            <br>
            Hardware can NOT be picked up at the electronic workshop.<br>
        </p>

            <br>
            <h2>How to return hardware:</h2>
            <p>All hardware needs to be returned to the Embedded Stock store, when the semester ends. This means either the end of January or June.<br>
                <br>
                Hardware may be modified with reasonable connectors and should be ready for use by the next loaner, when it is returned to Embedded Stock.<br>
                This means, hardware can NOT be soldered onto Vero-boards, or connected to other hardware, in any way on return.<br>
                <br>
                Please have your AU-id or Studie-id ready when you are at the store.<br>
                <br>
                Hardware can NOT be returned at the electronic workshop.</p>
